# vscode dedupe

A simple VS Code extension to dedupe (remove duplicate rows) of any file.

It will also count blank rows as duplicates, just FYI.

This is not published through the store, so just clone this into your vscode directory:

```
cd %USERPROFILE%
cd .vscode
git clone https://github.com/ericyd/vscode-dedupe 
```
